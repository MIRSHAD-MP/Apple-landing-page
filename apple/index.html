                1. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card when they purchase an eligible Mac or iPad at a
                Qualifying Location. Only one Apple Gift Card per eligible Mac or iPad per Qualified Purchaser. Offer
                subject to availability. While supplies last. Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the
                value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad, but will be charged for all
                items in their cart, including the Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and
                monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified
                Purchasers selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option) as payment type at checkout shall receive a discount
                equal to the value of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad. This will result in
                one ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the eligible iPad or Mac discounted by the instant credit,
                and a second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price of the Apple Gift Card. The total
                combined amount charged over the two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the original full
                retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for
                the Apple Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the eligible Mac or iPad. ACMI is
                subject to credit approval and credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range from
                12.49% to 23.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of July 1, 2022. If you choose the pay‑in‑full or
                one‑time‑payment option for an ACMI‑eligible purchase instead of choosing ACMI as the payment option at
                checkout, that purchase will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card. Taxes and
                shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are subject to your standard purchase APR. See the
                Apple Card Customer Agreement at
                https://www.goldmansachs.com/terms-and-conditions/Apple-Card-Customer-Agreement.pdf for more
                information. ACMI is not available for purchases made online at the following special stores: Apple
                Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small
                businesses; Government, and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs, or on refurbished devices. Apple
                Card is issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake City Branch. Available for qualifying applicants in
                the United States. If you reside in the U.S. territories, please call Goldman Sachs at 877-255-5923 with

                Apple Employee Purchase Plan or business loyalty pricing. Availability of in‑store promotion offerings
                may be limited by Apple Store location closures as a result of COVID‑19. Additional restrictions apply.
